# Imaginenc
Converts any file into an image, and images back to files.
Currently, there is no built-in way of knowing the file type of the converted image.
Linux users can use the `file` command.
Windows doesn't have anything by default, so users would need to download a Terminal Emulator.

### Planned Features:
- More intuitive usage.
- File type detection (for decoding images)
- Better encryption.
